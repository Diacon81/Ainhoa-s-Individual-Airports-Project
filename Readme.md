AIRPORT DATA. EXPLORATION AND ANALYSIS

- Description:
This project involves a comprehensive exploration of a transportation dataset using Pandas within Python. The dataset includes information about airports, train stations, and ferry terminals. The goal is to enhance data manipulation and analysis skills, providing tools to craft a narrative connecting data points to real-world implications in aeronautics and travel.

- Requirements:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
NumPy

- Execution Instructions:
Open the Jupyter Notebook.
Run each cell in sequential order.
Ensure the required libraries are installed.

- Project Structure:

- Record of Incidents:
● Learnings: creating Pandas Dataframes, Filtering Dataframe Values, Managing NaN Values and Bad Data, Statistical Analysis and Data Aggregation, and, Exporting Results into CSV Files.
● Conclusions: proper data handling is fundamental, as when dealing with real-world data, it's common to encounter null values, incorrect, or unusual information. This ensures or approximates an optimal result for analysis and decision-making; the reliability of conclusions relies on the quality and proper handling of the data.
● Challenges: data quality.
